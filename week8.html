<p>This week I experimented with fog and made some finishing touches to the Roboviewer program. 
Last week's fog had been in <code>GL_LINEAR</code> mode, so the density setting had no effect. 
I changed the fog mode to <code>GL_EXP</code> and added a feature allowing the user to change the
fog density. </p>
<p>I also changed all the scenes so that the ground  now extends to the entire width of the window. Previously,
the ground looked like a strip or a runway. I did this by eliminating the left and right walls, extending
the coordinates of the corners of the ground plane, and manipulating the camera coordinates.
</p>
<p>Finally, I started experimenting with depth cueing. Depth cueing uses <code>GL_LINEAR</code> fog to create
the illusion of an object fading into the background. The fading illusion works when the fog color is close to the background
color. Setting the <code>GL_FOG_START</code> and <code>GL_FOG_END</code> parameters changes when the object 
starts to fade. I added depth cueing to the nova scene (the outer space background) and the scene with the
plain blue background. Depth cueing is only enabled when regular <code>GL_EXP</code> fog is off. <!--(Note: A strange
phenomenon occurs when depth cueing is enabled. The back of the robot's texture starts to disappear when the
robot enters the background fog, but the front texture is still visible.)-->
</p>

<p><b>Key Bindings</b><br>
F1 - Changes texture or robot's torso.<br>
F2 - Changes scene.<br>
F3 - Toggles <code>GL_EXP</code> fog on and off.<br>
f - Increases fog density. Starting density is 0.<br>
d - Decreases fog density. <br>
c - Toggles depth cueing on and off. Only works in the nova scene and the plain blue sky scene when
q - Quits program.
<code>GL_EXP</code> fog is off.
