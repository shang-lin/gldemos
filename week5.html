      <b>Week 5 - Texture Mapping</b><br>
<p>This week I added texture-mapped scenery to the background of the Roboviewer. Loading bitmap files
requires writing some complicated code that I didn't have time for this week, so in this week's program
I again created my own textures by storing pixel values in a 64x64x4 array. </p>
<p>I also figured out how to use texture objects, which allow simultaneous multiple textures. To create 
texture objects, first an array of GLuints needs to be created. <code>glGenTextures</code> is called on the
array. The size of this array is the number of textures. Each element in the array can be bound to one 
texture. Several texture object arrays can exist at one time. Since I can use multiple textures now, the textures
on the robot's face and torso and the background textures coexist.</p>

<p>F1 toggles the texture on the robot's torso. F2 cycles through the background scenes. The three backgroud
scenes are grass with mountains, desert with mountains, and grass without mountains (sky only). This program
runs slowly on my computer, so I didn't run any long-lasting tests. I'm not sure what would happen if the robot
could walk all the way to the textured mountains in the background. Collision detection is an entirely different
topic beyond the scope of this project, so it's not something handled in this program.</p>
