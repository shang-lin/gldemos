      <p>
      For my CS 11 project I intend to learn texture mapping and animation in OpenGL. 
      As a demo, I will write a scenery changer program that contains an animated character,
      probably a robot of some sort. 
      The user will be able to select scenes by pressing a keyboard button. C++, OpenGL, and GLUT will be used to implement the demo.
      The reference book I am using to study OpenGL is the 
      <i>OpenGL SuperBible, Second Edition</i>
      by 
      Richard S. Wright, Jr., and Michael Sweet.
      </p>
      <p>
      This web page contains the timeline, weekly status reports, and file downloads.
      The timeline and details of the demo program are still subject to change. Source code,
      executables, and weekly status reports will be added as they are completed.
