      <h1>
         Week 3
      </h1>

      <p>
      This week's program animates the robot so that its legs move as if walking
      and its entire body is translated in the direction its walking. Pressing the
      arrow keys rotate the robot and change its direction.
      </p>

      I had problems setting the perspective projection. Right now the program
      uses an orthographic projection, which means that more distant objects do not
      appear smaller. Perspective projections, which use a pyramid-like object called
      a frustum to make projections, are more realistic because distant objects look
      smaller, while closer objects look bigger. When I used 
      <code>
         gluPerspective
      </code>

      to set the frustum, I couldn't find values for the field-of-view angle, near distance, and far distance that would project the robot to a reasonable size.
      </p>
      <p>
      Right now I'm still using orthographic projections, so when the robot walks
      toward the viewer, it doesn't look bigger as it approaches.
      </p>

      In last week's program, it seemed that the light followed the robot around
      so that the same face was always lit. It seems that this might be because of
      the way normals are set up. I used 
      <code>
         gluSolidCube
      </solid>
      to draw the robot's
      parts, so the normals were already set in that built-in function. In the next 
      few days I'll try redrawing the cubes with polygons and setting my own normals
      to see if that problem is fixed.
      </p>

      I have posted a new version of the program as week3-2.tar.gz. The robot is now drawn by using quads
      to form cubes that are then scaled. The normals are set manually so that now the lighting is correct. When
      the robot rotates, surfaces are lit or dimmened depending on their position. The projection used is now 
      an perspective projection. When the robot walks towards or away from the viewer, it now changes size depending
      on the distance between it and the viewer. It turned out that earlier problems with using 
      <code>
         gluPerspective
      </code>
      had been caused by reloading the identity matrix in the Robot::setup() method.
