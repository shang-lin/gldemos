    <h1>Week 1</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
      I have set up the web page and timeline for my project. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The first project, due next 
      week, will be a review of elements I've used before in OpenGL (transformations, lighting, shading).
      My first program will draw a 3D robot. Lighting and materials will determine
      the shading of the robot's body. In the following weeks I will get started on 
      animation using two different methods. The first method will move the camera to create
      the illusion of the robot moving. The second method will involve moving the robot itself
      while the camera is stationary. After animation,
      I will start working on texture mapping. During Week 5 I will
      add texture to the robot for a more interesting and realistic appearance. In Week 6
      I will start to use texture mapping to generate terrain. In Week 7 I will experiment
      with environmental effects like fog. In the final week I intend to put everything together
      in a demo program. GLUT will be used to create user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
      If the implementations go well, and if I have lots of time, I might start
      working on a project before its scheduled week. I will probably work on putting together 
the demo throughout the term and not just in Week 8.
